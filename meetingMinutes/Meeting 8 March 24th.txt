Research paper & spreadsheet
	- Can follow equation up until "R= (A’0 -A’)/(A’- A∞’)"
	- Tried to understand from paper but not sure how to get A0 and Amax
	
	- Have performed the run through manually and got expected results like in the spreadsheet
	

Can I send a full first draft Monday/Tuesday next week?
