Interim Demo Talking Points

So far development has focused on setting up the Mobile App and Backend Service

== Mobile App ==

Using Expo, an open source framework for React Native

	- React Native doesnt support HTML or CSS
	- Instead of using the DOM (Document Object Model), React Native uses components. E.g. SafeView, instead of div
	- Expo provides a suite of well-tested React Native modules that run on Android, iOS, and the web
	- Also provides a suite of tools for building, deploying, and updating your app.
	
Main workflow for development is;
	
	- Code written in React Native
	- ExpoCLI 'npm start' command
	- Generates QR Code which can be scanned using the Expo Go App
	- My application is then bundled and installed on my physical device
	
Development focus on the frontend so far has been on getting the camera enabled

Users can allow permissions, take photos with either side of the camera and retake on request


== Backend App ==

REST API to contain business logic and interact with Cloud Firestore Database

Firestore initializer reads keys from config file and makes a connection to the project

Inside repository class;
	- Database state can be fetched from Firestore Client
	- A future task is an interface for querying the datastore
	- The following line executes the query
	
Swagger page added for easier development and manual testing
