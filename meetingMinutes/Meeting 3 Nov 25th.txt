Meeting 3

Initial Project Plan still in progress. Can I send to you on Monday/Tuesday?
Schedule next meeting to run over

Looked into using Figma to prototype screen flow
Trello to track Sprint progress - start sprint this week?
Setup GitLab repo

Requirements better in text or maybe as user stories?
